## Tool Selection Justification

For this project, Replit Agent was chosen as the vibe coding tool. The main reason for this choice was its deep integration of AI directly into the development environment. Replit Agent allows developers to generate, modify, and test code without switching between different tools or windows, which makes the development process faster and more focused. Additionally, the browser-based setup removed the need for local installation, making it convenient for rapid project development.

Another important factor was the ability to interact with the AI using natural language prompts. This made it easier to describe the desired functionality at a high level and quickly receive working code, which aligns well with the concept of vibe coding.

## Development Process

The development process started with creating a new web project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Replit Agent was used to generate the initial structure of the Todo List application, including the main layout and core functionality. By providing clear prompts, the AI was able to produce working code for adding, editing, and deleting tasks.

During development, the project went through several iterations. After the first version was generated, the application was tested and small issues were identified, such as task persistence and user interaction details. Additional prompts were used to refine the logic and improve reliability. Overall, the AI significantly reduced the amount of manual coding required.

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the main challenges was ensuring that tasks were stored correctly and remained available after reloading the page. This was addressed by implementing localStorage, with guidance from the AI tool. Another challenge was maintaining clean and readable code while using automatically generated solutions. In some cases, minor manual adjustments were made to improve clarity and structure.

The AI tool was helpful in identifying errors and suggesting fixes, but human review was still necessary to verify that the application behaved as expected. This combination of AI assistance and manual checking resulted in a stable and functional project.

## Reflection

This project demonstrated how vibe coding tools can change the development workflow by allowing developers to focus more on ideas and functionality rather than low-level implementation details. One surprising aspect was how effectively the AI could understand high-level instructions and translate them into working code.

In the future, this type of tool would be useful for rapid prototyping, learning new technologies, and accelerating small to medium-sized projects. However, it is still important to understand the generated code and not rely entirely on AI. Overall, vibe coding tools have the potential to significantly impact software development by increasing productivity and lowering the barrier to entry.
